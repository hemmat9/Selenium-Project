***************XPATH***************
why do we need XPath locator?
developers may not have provided other locators in the html
by using xpath we can identify those webelements easily


What is an XPath?
xpath is just like a query language(any computer programming language that requests and retrieves data from database and information systems by sending queries)
that help us to identify elements.


Types of Xpath:
1- Absolute Xpath (full Xpath) -->Strats with a starting node in html
it starts with a single slash
(/)
e.g /html/body/div/div[2]/div/div/div/div/div[2]/div/div/form/div[2]/button



Example of Absolute XPath

<html>

    <head>

    </head>

        <body>

        <div>

             <a>dakdjf</a>

        </div>
               <div>
                <img> </img>
    </div>
    <div>
            <img2></img>
     </div>
    </body>
</html>
html/body/div[3]/img2

2- Relative Xpath
Syntax:
//tagname[@attribute='attribute value']
example:
//input[@type='password']//creating xpath for inputes(text boxes)
hey can you find me the tag input who has an attribute "type" whow attribute value is "password".


identifying xpath by its TEXT:
//tagname[text()='the text']
can you find me the tag a which has text of value "Text value"

Identifying elements using contain method
//tagname[contains(@attribute,'sometext')]
can you find me the tag which has the attribute "attribute" and it value contains "sometext"


The Advance Xpath
/*Identifying elements using advance xpath
example://label[text()="Enter message"]/following-sibling::input*/
