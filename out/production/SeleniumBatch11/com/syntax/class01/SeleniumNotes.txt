What is software testing?
verifying or certifying the quality and corrctnesss of the software

How many ways can we test a software?
1- Manual
2- Automation

When do we go for automation?
--frequent regression testing is required.
--repeated test case execution.
--efficincy.


What are the tools that we have for automation?
Selenium, UFT/QTP, Cucumber, TestNG, Katlon Studio

Levels of Testing?
1-Unite Testing
2-Integration Testing
3-System Testing
4-Acceptance Testing

Types of Testing?
1- Functional Teting (We test the functionality of software like buttons, pop-ups etc....)
2- Non-Functional Testing(performance, security)

What is Selenium?
A set of tools that help us to Automate testing of Web based applications only.

Selenium Suite.....................
1- Selenium IDE--> it is a plugin, record and play...
Cons: no programing test cases
2- Selenium RC(Remote Control)-->          a). Supports different Langugaes b). supports different browsers c). it requires a RC server
3- Selenium webdriver-->                   a). Supports different browsers b). supports different language
4- Selenium Grid-->                        a). Consists of a node and hub b). Run test cases in parallel on different browsers

Selenium 1
Selenium 2 --> Selenium RC and webDriver (Combined)
Selenium 3 --> some improvements in Selenium 2
Selenium 4 --> Some changes and improvements in the communication protocols


Advantage of Selenium:
--Open source
--Compatible with different Languages (Java, C#, ruby)
--it allows to have test cases to run on different browswers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
--it is not OS dependent (Windows, mac, linux)

Dis-Advantages of Selenium:
-- We do not have technical support as it is open source
-- we can not test desktop applications
-- we have no built in reports
-- can not test captaches , images and videos


Selenium Architectrure:




driver.close()---> it will close the tab that we are on

driver.quit()---> it will close the whole browser

get() vs navigate()
driver.get();--> using get we can not move forward or backward or refresh the web page.
driver.navigate(); --> using navigate we can go forward and backward and refresh the web pages.

-----------all webpages are made of usually HTML(HyperText Markup Language) ,CSS and js(Java Script)

    we have tags in HTML<>
    1. tags have different purposes  i.e to define heading, pragraphs, pictures e.t.c
    we must have an opening and a closing tag <> (Opening tag or node), </> (Closing tag or node).
    <html> ----> opening tab
        //here we writh anything we want
    </html>-----> closing tab
