Frames:
Identify the iFrames:
1-Right click on the frame, if you see view frame source then it is an iFrame.
2-The iFrames are emebedded in the wepage under the tag <iframe>, so search for "//iFrame" and it will show you those iFrames available.

Example:
<html>
    <body>
        <iFrame id="frame1">
        <html>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
        </iFrame>
    </body>
</html>
<html>
    <body>
        <iFrame id="frame2">
        <html>
            <body>
            </body>
        </html>
        </iFrame>
    </body>
</html>

Before interacting with frames we need to tell our driver to (switch to) the desired frame
to locate a frame we have three ways to interact with them
1- By index (driver.switch().frame(int index);
2- By name or ID (driver.swithTo().frame(String ID or Name);
3- By WebElement (driver.swithTo().frame(WebElement);

defaultContent()-----> switch the focus bat to the main page

in alerts--> no need to switch back focus
in frames--> we have to switch our focus back to home page

=============Authentication Alerts===========

Authentication Alerts we need to give user name and password
in order to handle them we pass the parameters i.e username and password in the url.

===================Windows Handle=============
Selenium treats windows and tabs equaly
WindowHandle:
each widow got a unique ID which is called window handle, it is 40 characters alphanumeric.

Handling window in Selenium:
In order to handle them we will be using methods:
1-getWindowHandle()-->give the address of the current window the selenium is focusing onto
2-getWindowsHandles()--> gives the address of all the windows

To switch to a particuler window
driver.switchTo().window(Handle of the desired window);
