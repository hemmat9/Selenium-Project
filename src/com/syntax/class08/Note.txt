************************Selenium Class 08****************

WindowHandles():
unique Id associated with each new window/tab

How do we handle multiple windows in selenium??
1. getAllwindowHandles() --> gets all the handles  --> return type : set of string
2.driver.switchTo.windows(desried windowhandle)

getwindowHandles()--> this mehtod is not taking care of mainting the order in which tabs were opened up


only 1 window or tab at a time


************waits***********
1.ImplicitWait
implicit wait is applied to all  "driver.FindElement"
if the element is found,no wait is apllied
if it is not found then the wait is applied  for a certain amount of time
*if the certain amount of time has passed and still the element we get an Exception
    "NoSuchElement"

  Syntax for this wait:
  driver.manage().timeouts().implicitwait(time,units)

   implicitwait(maximum amount of time before it throws an expception ,  units)


task:
goto http://syntaxprojects.com/dynamic-elements-loading.php
click on start btn
get the text and print on console

****implicit wait-->waits till the WebElement is found

2.ExplicitWait or WebDriver waits
these waits are used to tell the webdriver to wait till the certain condition is matched
