What is selenium?
A tool for Automating web Aplication tests only.

functional testing is done using selenium

components of Selenioum
selenium IDE, RC, WebDriver, Grid

we are using selenium 3
combination of WebDriver and RC

Advantages:
open source
works with all Operation Systems
works with different browsers and languages


dis-Advantages
no support
no built-in reports
no desktop application testing



WebDriver is an interface
1- Set system properties (Key, Value)
key is the driver that we are using
value is the path to that driver
2- create and object of chromedriver()
3- use method .get() and pass the url of the website that you want to launch


HTML

<html> tag or node
    <body>
        <input name="Farhad">//name is atribute and "Farhad" is value, we can have multipul attributes in a tag
    </body>
</html> tag or node

the webpage has an underlying html code
-- everything that we see on the webpage is basically appearing to us through some kind of code
-- everything in the inspect page is called DOM (Document Object Model) on the webpage click right and click on inspect (Shortcut FnKey+F12)


<input id="username"> dialoge box appears for entering username
<input id="password"> dialoge box appears for entering password
<button name ="login"><button> login button appears

--we call everything on a webpage webElement


Locator
it is the adress or the position of the WebElement on the page
we have 8 Locators:
1-id
2-name
3-tagname
4-classname
5-linktext
6-partiallinktext
7-Xpath
8-Css selector

if there are 2 element with same attribute names
then we use anohter locatgor to find the element, but we must make sure that the locator we are opting for is unique enough.
if there are 2 same attributes with same values selenium is going to return us the first one.

why do we need so many locators?
if the locator is not unique we can choose the one that is unique.
the developers may not provide us with all the locators

When do we get a noElement Exception?
when the Selenium is unable to find the element that we are looking for.
GO CHECK YOUR LOCATOR / ATTRIBUTE VALUE.

<a> anchor tag, it contains a link.
we can access this using locator "linktext or partiallink".

a webelement have an underlying code this html code starts with a tag
the tag may have different attributes these attributes are there to help locate those elements and in some
cases define the other criterias.
